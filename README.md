# AI Chatbot for IIT Jodhpur

This project involves developing an AI-powered chatbot to assist students, faculty, and staff at IIT Jodhpur. Using the **LangChain** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** frameworks, the chatbot provides immediate, accurate access to essential information from the IIT Jodhpur website.

## Project Overview

The AI chatbot aims to streamline the user experience by delivering interactive responses to frequently sought information, including:
- Academics and research resources
- Admissions information
- Faculty details
- Campus resources and administrative guidelines

The chatbot improves information accessibility and reduces the need for manual searches.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Automated scripts scrape relevant content from the IIT Jodhpur website, capturing details on departments, courses, faculty contacts, and other resources.
2. **Data Processing**: The data is cleaned and structured for effective retrieval, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
3. **Integration**: Using **LangChain** for managing conversation flow and **RAG** for retrieval, the chatbot dynamically generates responses based on the IIT Jodhpur dataset.
4. **Testing**: Thorough testing and validation ensure the chatbot provides accurate responses. Initial user feedback is used to refine its performance.

## Key Technologies

- **LangChain**: Manages natural language understanding and generation, structuring workflows and enabling memory and prompt engineering for a seamless conversational experience.
- **RAG**: Augments responses with contextually relevant information from the dataset, enhancing accuracy and relevance.
- **Python**: Primary language for scripting and automation.
- **Beautiful Soup & Selenium**: Tools for web scraping.
- **Streamlit**: Deploys the chatbot as a web application, providing a user-friendly interface.
- **Git**: Manages code changes and version control.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced User Experience**: Delivers relevant, up-to-date responses with a conversational interface.
- **24/7 Availability**: Accessible anytime, supporting users from different time zones.
- **Instant Access**: Reduces the need for extensive website searches, allowing quick answers to FAQs on academics, admissions, and more.

## Future Enhancements

Future improvements will focus on expanding the knowledge base, enhancing natural language processing capabilities, and integrating features based on user feedback.
